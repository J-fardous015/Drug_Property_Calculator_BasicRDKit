# Drug_Property_Calculator_(Basic RDKit)
This is a basic RDkit base drug properties calculator where Lipinski rules of 5 is also applied to measure a molecule as an oral drugness.

This project use RDKit in Python. RDKit itself a popular cheminformatics libraries, used to:
	-Convert Smiles string into Molecular structure
	-Calculate different molecular properties
	-Predict Oral_Drug likness of molecule through (Lipniski RO5)
	-Molecule grid visualization
	-Generating Scatter plot of molecule (LogP VS Molecular Weight)

The feature contains in this projects are:
	-#Smiles to Mols convertion
	-#Molecular Propeties:
		-LogP
		-Molecular weight
		-HBD (Hydrogen Bond Donors)
		-HBA (Hydrogen Bond Acceptor)
		-Rotatable Bonds
		-TPSA (Topological Polar Surface Area )
		-Rings
	-#Lipinski Rules of 5 (Pass/Fail class)
	-#Molecular grid visualization
	-#Scatter Plot of LogP VS Molecular Weight
	-#Final Clean data of mole properties, export in CSV

Input of this projects : 
	-Molecule Name, 
	-Smiles


This project is a part of my practice of RDKit using python programming as a beginner in the feild of Drug Discovery in AI.
